Build dictionary of the integer array.
Use a nest forloop to check if any two numbers add up to the negative
of a third number, which will be found in the dictionary just created.

nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4] 

nums_dict = 
                {
                    0: -1
                    1, 0
                    2, 1
                    3, 2
                    4, -1
                    5, -4
                }
